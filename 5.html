            <h6>Overview:</h6>
            <p> The kidneys' function is to filter the blood. All the blood in
                our body passes through the kidneys several times a day.
                The kidneys remove wastes, control the body's fluid balance, and
                regulate the balance of electrolytes.
                As the kidneys filter blood, they create urine, which collects
                in the kidneys' pelvis; funnel-shaped structures that drain down
                tubes called ureters to the bladder.<br> <br>
                Each kidney contains around a million units called nephrons,
                each of which is a microscopic filter for blood.
                It's possible to lose as much as 90% of kidney function without
                experiencing any symptoms or problems.
                <br> <br> <br>
                Ascertaining that the Kidney is one of the most vital organs in
                the human body, a dedicated department has been set up to
                facilitate and treat any kind of Kidney Disorders. Some of the
                Kidney Conditions are:

            <h6>Living Kidney Donor</h6>
            <h6>How do family and friends know when it is time to consider
                donation?</h6>

            <p> When a patient loses 90 to 95 percent of his or her kidney
                function, they are considered to have End Stage Renal Disease
                (ESRD).
                Treatment options for patients with ESRD are dialysis (where an
                artificial kidney machine removes waste from the blood) or a
                kidney transplant from a living or deceased donor. <br> <br>
                Sometimes, a patient with 85 percent loss of kidney function
                will undergo a transplant which allows them to avoid having to
                go on dialysis. Kidney patients and their families will discuss
                the best course of treatment with their doctors.

            </p>

            <h6>Pap smear and Colposcopy (for abnormal smears)</h6>
            <p>Pap smear is a diagnostic test of a sample of cells collected
                from the surface of a woman's cervix
                (the lower, narrow end of a woman's uterus) to check for
                inflammation, infection or abnormalities
                that can develop into cancer. A Colposcopy is a procedure in
                which a special magnifying device
                with a light called a colposcope is used to visually examine the
                vagina and cervix.
                This procedure is normally carried out after a smear result is
                found to be abnormal as it
                gives more information about abnormal cells that could lead to
                cancer. The procedure can be used
                to direct the location of where a tissue biopsy should be done
                and it can also be used to monitor
                treatment of cervix abnormalities. Jehangir Hospital is one of
                the VERY FEW hospitals in Pune offering this test.
            </p>

            <h6>Who can be a donor?</h6>
            <p>Donors need to be between the ages of 18 and early 60s and can
                include parents,
                Grandparents, siblings, Spouse, Children, Grandchildren. An
                ideal donor should have a
                genuine interest in donating. Compatible blood type is no more
                must for a donor. Donor
                should be in good general health. Typically, someone who has
                cancer, diabetes, kidney disease,
                heart disease, liver disease, sickle cell disease, HIV or
                hepatitis will not qualify to be a donor.
                However, these diseases are not all absolute contraindications
                to donation. Every donor will be
                considered on an individual basis.
            </p>

            <h6>Do some donors have trouble making the decision to donate?</h6>
            <p> The decision to donate can vary from person to person. Some
                people make the decision instantly with few worries or concerns.
                Other people require time to think critically and will talk with
                close friends or family before deciding whether or not to
                donate.
                It is normal for some people to be afraid of donating a kidney
                as well as to experience guilt about not wanting to be a
                donor.<br> <br>
                Individuals should not, under any circumstances, feel pressured
                to donate. The only “right” decision is the one that makes the
                donor feel comfortable. Potential donors are encouraged to speak
                with the consultant, Transplant Coordinator living donor team if
                they have any questions or concerns about their decision.
            </p>

            <h6>What is the first step to becoming a living donor?
            </h6>
            <p> Donor’s health is prim important aspect in any kind of organ
                donation. Only after comprehensive health assessment of the
                donor he/ she will be considered fit to donate organ to his/her
                relative.
            </p>

            <h6> What does the donor evaluation include?
            </h6>
            <p> We encourage all donor evaluations to be completed at Jehangir
                Hospital, Pune. The work-up can
                often be completed in 1-2 days, though additional testing may be
                required in some cases.<br> <br>
                You will complete a medical history and receive a physical,
                which includes a blood pressure check
                , to ensure that you don’t have any concerning health
                conditions.<br> <br> A series of laboratory and X-ray
                tests, as well as an EKG, will be completed to screen for kidney
                function, liver function, hepatitis, heart disease, lung disease
                and past exposure to viral illness. Urine testing
                will also be done to make sure that your kidneys function
                normally.<br> <br> In addition, results from your routine annual
                health maintenance tests (e.g., pap smear, mammogram,
                colonoscopy, etc).
                A Computerized tomography or CTA) scan will also be completed.
                During this scan, contgiogram
                (a contrast is injected into the blood stream through a vein in
                your arm.<br> <br> The contrast travels
                to the kidneys and urinary tract while the CTA scan and X-rays
                are done. These tests help the transplant
                staff to determine if your urinary tract, kidneys, and the blood
                vessels leading to the kidneys are normal. <br> <br>
                Once all results from the entire evaluation process are
                available, it will be determined by the independent physician
                whether you are able to safely proceed with the donation.
            </p>
            <h6>Deceased Kidney Donors</h6>
            <p>If you have no living donor available, you have an option of
                registering for Deceased donor kidney transplant.
                Regardless of your donor, you’ll still undergo the same thorough
                evaluation to determine whether you’re a candidate
                for transplant surgery. You cannot receive a kidney transplant
                before the completion of all tests and consultations
                recommended by the Doctor. Once you’re approved for transplant,
                you’ll be placed on the organ waiting list, at which
                point you begin to accrue waiting time.
            </p>

            <h6>While You Wait</h6>
            <p>The waiting period often is several months to years, so you may
                be asked to undergo periodic testing to remain “active” on the
                waiting list.
                You’ll continue to be cared for by your Nephrologist
                Above all, because the waiting period can be extended, it’s
                important for you to let the Nephrologist know about any serious
                changes
                in your health. Keeping us updated improves the chances of a
                timely transplantation</p>
