            <h3>Overview:</h3>

            <p>Few know about the advantages of regular exercise; being active
                is one of the best ways you can keep your bones and joints
                working well.<br> Exercise helps you maintain bone density as
                you get older, lessen joint pain, keep off extra weight that can
                stress your joints and more importantly regular exercise helps
                you balance so you avoid falls that can damage bones and
                joints.<br> <br>

                Take time off from your busy schedule to go biking or swimming
                with your family or friends, outdoor activities not only refresh
                your mind but help maintain a healthy heart and lungs conversely
                helping in bone and muscle strengthening.<br> <br>

                Get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity every week,
                including some weight-bearing exercise. That amounts to about 30
                minutes a day, 5 days a week, bearing in mind the hectic
                lifestyle you can find ways to build activity into your daily
                routine.<br> <br> whether it's household work or taking a brisk
                walk with a friend.

                Make sure you combine flexibility exercise along with the daily
                workout regime, such as yoga and stretches that are also good
                for the joints.<br><br>
