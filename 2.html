            <h3>Overview:</h3>

            <p>Heart Care is one of the most crucial and neglected facet of
                Health Care, which is often delayed and kept aside for later,
                that can turn out to be a life taking situation! At Jehangir, we
                aim to deliver the best with technologically advanced treatments
                when it comes to your heart.<br> <br>

                Cardiovascular disease includes a number of conditions affecting
                the structure or function of the heart. Research shows that
                cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among men
                in India. It is also the leading cause of hospitalization for
                people older than 65.<br> <br>

                Hence it is important to learn about your heart to help prevent
                heart disease.<br> <br>

                The term "heart failure" can be frightening. It does not mean
                the heart has "failed" or stopped working. It means that the
                heart does not pump as well as it should. This then leads to
                salt and water retention, causing swelling and shortness of
                breath. The swelling and shortness of breath are the primary
                symptoms of heart failure.<br> <br>

                At Jehangir Hospital we aim to understand the step-by-step
                process leading to a heart attack thereby fully understanding
                the major risk factors concerned. The main factors that might
                lead to heart problems are high blood pressure, high
                cholesterol, obesity, smoking and a sedentary lifestyle. Stress
                is also believed to raise the risk and exertion and excitement
                can act as triggers for an attack.<br> <br>

                Thus, we aim to provide the best round the clock Heart Care
                services in Pune, which are dedicated in give you an opportunity
                to live a healthier life!<br> <br>
