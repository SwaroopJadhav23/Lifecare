                Laparoscopic literally means taking a look inside the abdominal
                cavity with the help of a telescope. Nowadays, this imaging
                technique is not restricted to just diagnosis, but the entire
                operative procedure can be completed laparoscopically.
                It can be availed for both Diagnostic & Surgical needs.
                Procedures offered include laparoscopic management of ectopic
                pregnancies, ovarian cysts, hysterectomy, removal of fibroids
                and laparoscopic hysterectomy – For a quicker recovery.<br> <br>

                Life care Hospital, Pune has gained the reputation of being the
                best centre in the region for Obstetrics and Gynecological
                services over the last 7 decades.
                Mother and child care being our focus at Jehangir, we believe
                that every mother and baby deserves the best care possible –
                before, during and after a precious newborn enters the
                world.<br> <br>

                There can be varied forms of complication among women before,
                during and after giving birth to a child. Some of the commonly
                found issues are stated below for your better understanding of
                what we deal with on a day -to- day routine.</p>

            <h6>hysterectomy</h6>

            <p>Having heavy, prolonged and painful periods might be due to some
                abnormality in the uterus.
                An abdominal hysterectomy is removal of the uterus through a cut
                in your lower abdomen which will offer a solution to the
                problem.
                The operation may include removal of the cervix; this is called
                a total abdominal hysterectomy or TAH.
                Sometimes the cervix is not removed; this is called a sub-total
                abdominal hysterectomy.
            </p>

            <h6>Pap smear and Colposcopy (for abnormal smears)</h6>
            <p>Pap smear is a diagnostic test of a sample of cells collected
                from the surface of a woman's cervix
                (the lower, narrow end of a woman's uterus) to check for
                inflammation, infection or abnormalities
                that can develop into cancer. A Colposcopy is a procedure in
                which a special magnifying device
                with a light called a colposcope is used to visually examine the
                vagina and cervix.
                This procedure is normally carried out after a smear result is
                found to be abnormal as it
                gives more information about abnormal cells that could lead to
                cancer. The procedure can be used
                to direct the location of where a tissue biopsy should be done
                and it can also be used to monitor
                treatment of cervix abnormalities. Jehangir Hospital is one of
                the VERY FEW hospitals in Pune offering this test.
            </p>

            <h6>Endometriosis treatment</h6>
            <p>Endometriosis is a chronic disease involving endometrial tissue.
                Normally, endometrial tissue is found only inside the uterus,
                the reproductive organ where a foetus develops. In
                endometriosis,
                endometrial-like tissue is found outside the uterus. It may be
                found on organs in the abdomen,
                pelvis or another location. Outside the uterus, the tissue
                continues to respond to hormones.
                It swells, breaks down, and bleeds but it is unable to pass from
                the body during menstruation.
                Surrounding tissue becomes inflamed, often with scarring. At
                Jehangir, specialized gynecologists
                attend to such problems giving you different choices of
                treatments as applicable.
            </p>

            <h6>Fibroids treatment</h6>
            <p>Fibroids are growths that form in the uterus (womb).
                They are benign (not cancerous) and are made up of muscle fiber.
                Fibroids can be as small as a pea and can grow as large as a
                melon.
                Fibroids are most common in women in their 30s and 40s, and tend
                to shrink after the menopause.
            </p>

            <h6>Urinary Incontinence treatment</h6>
            <p>Urinary incontinence is the loss of voluntary bladder control
                leading to the leakage of urine.
                It can be temporary or chronic. Incontinence is a symptom, not a
                condition in itself.
                In some cases, incontinence may have several different causes or
                sometimes the cause is unclear.
            </p>

            <h6>Infections (UTI, Pelvic inflammatory disease) treatment</h6>
            <p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) which are a common problem found
                among many women
                consulting expert gynecologists at Jehangir are caused by
                bacteria that invade the urinary
                system and multiply. The infection can occur in any part of the
                urinary system, but usually
                starts in the urethra (a tube that carries the urine out of the
                body). Pelvic inflammatory disease
                (PID) is a serious infection of the female reproductive organs.
                These include the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes.
                PID can cause scar tissue to form in the pelvis and fallopian
                tubes. This damage may result in infertility,
                a future tubal pregnancy or chronic pelvic pain.
