            <p>Liver disease is a general term that refers to any condition
                affecting your liver.<br>
                These conditions may develop for different reasons, but they can
                all damage your liver and affect its function.<br>
                Your liver is a vital organ that performs hundreds of tasks
                related to metabolism, energy storage, and waste filtering.
                <br> It helps you digest food, convert it to energy, and store
                the energy until you need it. It also helps filter toxic
                substances out of your bloodstream.

            </p>

            <h6>What are the general symptoms?</h6>
            <p>
                Liver disease symptoms vary, depending on the underlying cause.
                It’s also possible for someone to have liver disease and not
                have any symptoms at all. However, Hepatitis NSW says that a few
                general symptoms can indicate some kind of severe liver damage.
                <br>
                These include:<br>

                yellowish skin and eyes, known as jaundice <br>
                pale, bloody, or black stools <br>
                enlarged stomach due to ascites, which may make it uncomfortable
                to lie down or eat <br>
                encephalopathy, a brain issue resulting in marked changes in
                mood, sleep, and cognition

            </p>

            <h6>Hepatitis</h6>
            <p> Hepatitis is defined as an inflammation of the liver. <br>
                When that inflammation is caused by a virus, it’s referred to as
                viral hepatitis. <br>
                Hepatitis can cause liver damage, making it difficult for your
                liver to function as it should. <br>
                Most types of viral hepatitis are contagious, but you can reduce
                your risk by getting vaccinated for types A and B . <br>
                By taking other preventive steps, including using a condom
                during sex and not sharing needles.
            </p>

            <h6>Five types of hepatitis include:
            </h6>
            <p>Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A is typically spread through contact with
                contaminated food or water. Symptoms may clear up without
                treatment, but recovery can take a few weeks.<br> <br>
                Hepatitis B. This type of viral hepatitis can be acute
                (short-term) or chronic (long-term). It’s spread through bodily
                fluids, such as blood and semen. While hepatitis B is treatable,
                there’s no cure for it. Early treatment is key to avoiding
                complications, so it’s best to get regular screenings if you’re
                at risk.<br> <br>
                Hepatitis C. Hepatitis C can also be acute or chronic. It’s
                often spread through contact with blood from someone with
                hepatitis C. While it often doesn’t cause symptoms in its early
                stages, it can lead to permanent liver damage in its later
                stages.<br> <br>
                Hepatitis D. This is a serious form of hepatitis that only
                develops in people with hepatitis B — it can’t be contracted on
                its own. It can also be either acute or chronic.<br> <br>
                Hepatitis E. Hepatitis E is usually caused by drinking
                contaminated water. Generally, it clears up on its own within a
                few weeks without any lasting complications. <br> <br>

            </p>

            <h6>Fatty liver disease</h6>
            <p>Fat buildup in the liver can lead to fatty liver disease.<br>
                There are two types of fatty liver disease. These two types can
                manifest alone, or they can overlap: <br> <br>
                alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is caused by heavy alcohol
                consumption
                nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is caused by other
                factors experts are still trying to understand
                Without management, both types of fatty liver disease can cause
                liver damage, leading to cirrhosis and liver failure.
                <br> <br> Diet and other lifestyle changes can often improve
                symptoms and lower your risk of complications.</p>

            <h6>Autoimmune conditions</h6>
            <p>Autoimmune conditions involve your immune system mistakenly
                attacking healthy cells in your body.
                <br> <br> Several autoimmune conditions involve your immune
                system attacking cells in your liver,<br> <br>
                including:<br>
                Autoimmune hepatitis.
                <br> This condition causes your immune system to attack your
                liver, resulting in inflammation.
                <br>Without treatment, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver
                failure. <br>
                Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
                <br> This results from damage to the bile ducts in your liver,
                causing a buildup of bile.
                <br> PBC can eventually lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.
                Primary sclerosing cholangitis. This inflammatory condition
                causes gradual damage to your bile ducts.
                <br> They eventually become blocked, causing bile to build up in
                your liver.
                <br> This can lead to cirrhosis or liver failure.</p>
