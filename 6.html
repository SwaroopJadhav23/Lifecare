            <h6>Overview
            </h6>
            <p> Rehabilitation is defined as “a set of interventions designed to
                optimize functioning and reduce disability in individuals with
                health conditions in interaction with their environment”.<br>
                Put simply, rehabilitation helps a child, adult or older person
                to be as independent as possible in everyday activities and
                enables participation in education, work, recreation and
                meaningful
                life roles such as taking care of family.<br> <br> It does so by
                working with the person and their family to address underlying
                health conditions and their symptoms, modifying their
                environment to better suit their needs,
                using assistive products, educating to strengthen
                self-management, and adapting tasks so that they can be
                performed more safely and independently. <br> <br>Together,
                these strategies can help an individual; overcome difficulties
                with thinking,
                seeing, hearing, communicating, eating or moving around.<br>
                <br>
                Anybody may need rehabilitation at some point in their lives,
                following an injury, surgery, disease or illness, or because
                their functioning has declined with age.

            <h6>Key Facts</h6>
            <p>
                Rehabilitation is an essential part of universal health coverage
                along with promotion of good health, prevention of disease,
                Rehabilitation helps a child, adult or older person to be as
                independent as possible in everyday activities and enables
                participation in education. <br> <br> work, recreation and
                meaningful life roles such as taking care of family
                Globally, an estimated 2.4 billion people are currently living
                with a health condition that may benefit from rehabilitation<br>
                <br>
                Assistive technology based cognitive rehabilitationThe need for
                rehabilitation worldwide is predicted to increase due to changes
                in the health and characteristics of the population. <br> <br>
                For example, people are living longer, but with more chronic
                disease and disability
                Currently, the need for rehabilitation is largely unmet. In some
                low- and middle-income countries, more than 50% of people do not
                receive the rehabilitation services they require. Emergencies
                including conflicts. <br> <br> disasters and outbreaks create
                enormous surges in rehabilitation needs while also disrupting
                rehabilitation services
                Rehabilitation is an important part of universal health coverage
                and is a key strategy for achieving Sustainable Development Goal
                3 – “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all
                ages”

            <h6>The benefits of rehabilitation</h6>
            <p>Rehabilitation can reduce the impact of a broad range of health
                conditions, including diseases (acute or chronic), illnesses or
                injuries. It complements other health interventions, such as
                medical and surgical interventions, helping to facilitate
                recovery and achieve the best outcome possible. In addition,
                rehabilitation can help to prevent, reduce or manage
                complications associated with many health conditions, such as in
                the context of spinal cord injury, stroke, or fractures.<br>
                <br>
                Rehabilitation helps to minimize or slow down the disabling
                effects of chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular
                disease, cancer and diabetes by equipping people with
                self-management strategies and the assistive products they
                require, or by addressing pain or other complications. As such,
                it contributes to healthy ageing. <br> <br>
                Rehabilitation is an investment, with cost benefits for both the
                individuals and society. It can help to avoid costly
                hospitalization, reduce hospital length of stay, and prevent
                re-admissions. As rehabilitation also enables individuals to
                engage in or return to work and employment, or to remain
                independent at home, it minimizes the need for financial or
                caregiver support.<br> <br>
                Rehabilitation is an important part of universal health coverage
                and is a key strategy for achieving Sustainable Development Goal
                3 – “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all
                ages”.</p>

            <h6>Misconceptions about rehabilitation </h6>
            <p>Rehabilitation is not only for people with disabilities or
                long-term or physical impairments. Rather, rehabilitation is an
                essential health service for anyone with an acute or chronic
                health condition, impairment or injury that limits functioning,
                and as such should be available for anyone who needs it.<br>
                <br>

                Rehabilitation is not a luxury health service that is available
                only for those who can afford it. Nor is it an optional service
                to try only when other interventions to prevent or cure a health
                condition fail. <br> <br>
                For the full extent of the social, economic and health benefits
                of rehabilitation to be realized, timely, high quality and
                affordable rehabilitation interventions should be available to
                all. In many cases, this means starting rehabilitation as soon
                as a health condition is noted and continuing to deliver
                rehabilitation alongside other health interventions.
